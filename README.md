# fallback-vulnerability
A fallback ctf 
Upon looking at the code you will notice that if you contribute more than 1000 ether to the contract then you will become the owner.and the owner can withdraw the funds.
There is though a part that says require "(msg.value < 0.001 ether);" within the contribute function and we can use it to our advantage by sending less than 0.0001. 
Notice i said send and not contribute. I contributed firstly to interact with the contract then i used getcontribution to check that the eth went to it and then i ran the send transaction function leaving the data field empty and sending less than 0.0001.
The contract does not know how to react to that and makes you the owner. <img width="1536" alt="fallback" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63403890/185649820-af496778-c564-4a1d-bf5b-8e97f461df30.png">
